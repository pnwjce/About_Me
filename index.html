    <p>Hello and Welcome! I am a Software Developer, amateur photographer, and lifelong lover of the outdoors. Born in Seattle, I have been able to witness it's rise as a tech hub. I finally decided to see what it was all about. I am a current student at Code Fellows, and I am excited to learn more and more daily.</p>
